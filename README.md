## üöÄ How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository**:  

   To run the project locally, clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/oVitorio-ac/pythonVim.git
   cd pythonVim
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment**:  

   Create and activate a virtual environment using `pipenv` to manage dependencies:

   ```bash
   # Install pipenv if not already installed
    python -m venv .venv
    .\.venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install pipenv
    # Create and activate the virtual environment
    pipenv install
   ```

3. **Run the Python script**:  

   Execute the Python script to start using the editor:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Optional: Use OnlineGDB**:  

   If you'd prefer an online solution, you can upload the script to [OnlineGDB](https://www.onlinegdb.com/_www_7lvb?classId=ca4e133a-0236-4601-b403-6bd1ba97a369&assignmentId=d435f079-f0ae-4d22-9a64-ca87f42cf98e&submissionId=10b584aa-071e-b61c-c94a-238688755fa3) and run it there.
